# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI-Driven Robotics Book! In this module, we'll explore the world of digital twins for robotics, focusing on physics simulation and sensor modeling for humanoid robots. This module builds upon the ROS 2 fundamentals you learned in Module 1 and introduces you to simulation environments that are crucial for robotics development.

## What You'll Learn

This module covers three core areas of digital twin technology:

1. **Gazebo Fundamentals**: Master physics simulation with realistic gravity, collisions, and environmental interactions
2. **High-Fidelity Rendering**: Experience Unity-based visualization for enhanced human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation**: Work with realistic LiDAR, depth camera, and IMU data in simulated environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Computer with sufficient resources for simulation (8GB+ RAM recommended)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure physics-based simulation environments using Gazebo
- Integrate Unity for high-fidelity visual rendering and debugging
- Work with realistic sensor data streams for navigation and control algorithms
- Apply simulation techniques to prepare for real-world robotics development

## Chapter Overview

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of digital twin technology for robotics:

- **Chapter 1**: Focuses on Gazebo physics simulation fundamentals
- **Chapter 2**: Explores Unity integration for enhanced visualization
- **Chapter 3**: Covers sensor simulation for perception systems

Let's begin our journey into the world of digital twins for robotics!
