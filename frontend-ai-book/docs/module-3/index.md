# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3, where you'll explore advanced perception and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac for humanoid robots. This module builds upon the foundations laid in Module 1 (ROS 2 basics) and Module 2 (simulation concepts) to create a complete AI-robot brain system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Generate synthetic training data using NVIDIA Isaac Sim
2. Implement hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM (VSLAM) with Isaac ROS
3. Configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid path planning
4. Integrate all components in the Isaac Sim → ROS 2 → Gazebo pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Completion of Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Access to NVIDIA GPU for Isaac Sim acceleration
- Basic Python programming knowledge for robotics

## Module Structure

This module consists of three main chapters that progressively build your understanding of AI-driven robotics:

- **Chapter 1**: Isaac Sim - Learn to create photorealistic environments and generate synthetic training data
- **Chapter 2**: Isaac ROS & VSLAM - Implement hardware-accelerated visual SLAM for environment mapping
- **Chapter 3**: Nav2 Path Planning - Configure navigation for bipedal humanoid movement

## Sequential Dependency

This module follows the sequential dependency: Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3. Each chapter builds upon the previous ones, creating a complete AI-robot brain system that connects Isaac Sim, ROS 2, and Gazebo environments.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have implemented a complete AI-robot brain system that:
- Generates synthetic training data in Isaac Sim
- Creates real-time environment maps using VSLAM
- Plans navigation paths for bipedal humanoid robots
- Integrates all components in the Isaac Sim → ROS 2 → Gazebo pipeline
