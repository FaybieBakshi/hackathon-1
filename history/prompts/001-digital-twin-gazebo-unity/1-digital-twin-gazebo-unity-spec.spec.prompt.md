# Feature Specification Created: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) for Humanoid Robot Simulation

## Prompt Text
```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Audience: Students who completed Module 1 (ROS 2 basics)
Focus: Physics simulation and sensor modeling for humanoid robots

Chapters:
1. Gazebo Fundamentals: Physics, gravity, collisions
2. High-Fidelity Rendering: Unity for human-robot interaction
3. Sensor Simulation: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs in Gazebo
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive feature specification for the Digital Twin simulation environment integrating Gazebo and Unity for humanoid robot physics simulation and sensor modeling. The specification includes user scenarios for physics simulation, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor integration, along with functional requirements and success criteria. Two areas initially requiring clarification (real-time synchronization requirements and supported robot models) were resolved with reasonable assumptions suitable for educational purposes.

## Outcome
SUCCESS: Specification created and validated with quality checklist completed.
