# Implementation Plan Created: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) for Humanoid Robot Simulation

## Prompt Text
```
- Set up Module-2 in Docusaurus with structure chapter for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, enviroments , sensors). - All content written as .mdfiles,organized per chapter for easy navigation
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin simulation module in Docusaurus, including research findings, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts. The plan organizes content into three chapters as specified (Gazebo fundamentals, Unity rendering, sensor simulation) with proper documentation structure for easy navigation. All artifacts were created according to the Spec-Kit Plus methodology.

## Outcome
SUCCESS: Implementation plan completed with all required artifacts.
