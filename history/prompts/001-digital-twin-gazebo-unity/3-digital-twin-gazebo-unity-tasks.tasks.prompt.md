# Tasks Created: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) for Humanoid Robot Simulation

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin simulation module, organizing work by user stories (Gazebo Physics, Unity Rendering, Sensor Simulation) with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Tasks are structured to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, following the Spec-Kit Plus methodology.

## Outcome
SUCCESS: Task list generated with 39 tasks organized across 6 phases.
