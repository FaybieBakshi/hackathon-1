# Implementation Completed: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics

## Prompt Text
```
now you can implement the module-4 and Chapters in the frontend-ai-book  folder there is already module-1 content.
```

## Response Text
Successfully implemented Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics in the frontend-ai-book folder. Created all required documentation files including: module-4/index.md, voice-to-action.md, cognitive-planning.md, and capstone-project.md. Updated the sidebar.js to include the new module navigation. Created tutorial files for setup, troubleshooting, and advanced topics. All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as finished. The implementation follows the specified three-phase approach: Phase 1 (Voice Processing with Whisper to ROS actions), Phase 2 (Cognitive Planning with LLMs), and Phase 3 (Capstone Integration with full pipeline). The system demonstrates the complete pipeline: Voice → LLM → Planning → Navigation → Action.

## Outcome
SUCCESS: Complete Module 4 implementation with all documentation and integration completed.
