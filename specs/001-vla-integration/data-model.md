# Data Model: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics

**Feature**: 001-vla-integration
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This data model describes the key data structures and entities used in the Vision-Language-Action module, focusing on voice processing, LLM integration, and action planning for humanoid robots. The model aligns with the specific implementation phases from user input: voice processing, cognitive planning, and capstone integration.

## Core Entities

### Voice Command
- **Description**: Natural language input processed through speech-to-text with mapping to ROS 2 actions
- **Attributes**:
  - Audio data (raw voice input)
  - Transcribed text from Whisper processing
  - Command intent classification
  - Confidence score
  - Processing timestamp
  - Associated ROS action mapping
  - Voice command pipeline stage
  - Conversion status (Voice → ROS action)

### Action Sequence
- **Description**: Sequence of ROS 2 actions generated by LLM planning with cognitive planning context
- **Attributes**:
  - Sequence ID
  - List of ROS action steps
  - Execution dependencies
  - Success criteria
  - Estimated execution time
  - Safety validation status
  - LLM prompt context
  - Task decomposition details
  - Generation timestamp

### VLA Pipeline
- **Description**: Complete system state tracking the end-to-end VLA process from voice to action
- **Attributes**:
  - Voice input stage (Phase 1: OpenAI Whisper setup, ROS 2 action server, voice command pipeline)
  - Cognitive planning stage (Phase 2: LLM prompt engineering, task decomposition, ROS 2 sequence generation)
  - Capstone integration stage (Phase 3: Full pipeline integration with voice, LLM, navigation, manipulation)
  - Processing stage (Whisper, LLM, action generation)
  - Execution stage
  - Error states and recovery actions
  - Performance metrics
  - End-to-end pipeline status (Voice → LLM → Planning → Navigation → Action)

### LLM Response
- **Description**: Output from Large Language Model processing with task decomposition capabilities
- **Attributes**:
  - Input prompt (natural language command)
  - Generated action sequence (executable ROS 2 action sequence)
  - Confidence in plan validity
  - Context information
  - Safety validation results
  - Task decomposition details (natural language → executable action sequence)
  - Prompt engineering metadata

## Data Flow

1. **Voice Processing Phase**: Audio input → Whisper transcription → Command classification → ROS action conversion (Voice → ROS action conversion)
2. **Cognitive Planning Phase**: Transcribed command → LLM processing → Task decomposition → Action sequence generation (Natural language → executable action sequence)
3. **Capstone Integration Phase**: Voice + LLM + navigation + manipulation → Full pipeline integration → Complete autonomous humanoid simulation project
4. **End-to-End Pipeline**: Voice → LLM → Planning → Navigation → Action execution
5. **Feedback Loop**: Execution results → Performance metrics → System improvement

## Relationships

- Voice commands trigger action sequence generation through Whisper and LLM processing
- LLM responses define action sequences for robot execution with cognitive planning context
- VLA pipeline tracks the entire process from voice to action across all three implementation phases
- Performance metrics feed back to improve system accuracy across the 1→2→3→4 dependency chain
- Sequential dependency: Module 1 (ROS 2) → Module 2 (Simulation) → Module 3 (AI-Robot Brain) → Module 4 (VLA Integration)
